COLOMBIA BUSINESS ASKED TO DIVERSIFY FROM COFFEE

BOGOTA, April 8 -

A Colombia government trade official has urged the business community
to aggressively diversify its activities and stop relying so heavily
on coffee.  Samuel Alberto Yohai, director of the Foreign Trade
Institute, INCOMEX, said private businessmen should not become what he
called "mental hostages" to coffee, traditionally Colombia's major
export.  The National Planning Department forecast that in 1987 coffee
will account for only one-third of total exports, or about 1.5 billion
dlrs, with oil and energy products making up another third and
non-traditional exports the remainder.  Reuter
